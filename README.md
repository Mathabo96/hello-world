## About me
*I'm a GAP intern at Dimension Data. I'm keen to learn more about the ins and outs of this dynamic company as I am new to the tech industry, and I'm ready to develop some of the skills I've gained over the years in my career. I love food - whether it's developing new recipes from the top of my head or trying out the most common lockdown cravings, I'm in! I'm a helpful and out-going person, ready to throw sarcastic jabs or crack a joke to keep the mood light.I love learning, and always want to try get something right by myself before resorting to the Google search bar.*
